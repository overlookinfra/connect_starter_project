# This is an example inventory.yaml
# To read more about inventory files, see https://pup.pt/bolt-inventory
#
# There are two example targets. The example below uses fake locations for
# each target's "uri" data. In order to use this example data you must update
# the "uri" values to point to real targets.
#
# This example shows the format for a common workflow used to connect to
# targets, specifically targets accessed over SSH using an SSH private key

# Config data in this top-level location will apply to all targets in the
# inventory file that do not set config individually.
